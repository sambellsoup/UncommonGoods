Comparing Experience A and B with Mobile and Desktop

Comparing the A and B experiences, there is virtually no difference in visitors. There is a slight difference in number of orders, and revenue. Experience B is associated with slightly higher orders and higher revenue. The difference is very small though:

Experience A orders -		12,016
Experience B orders -		12,080

Experience A revenue -	$893,484.32
Experience B revenue -	$901,878.40

This data only covers January 2017, and the difference is miniscule. After setting the alpha level to 0.05, I conducted Independent Samples t Tests, which yielded higher p-values. I failed to reject the null hypotheses. The difference in revenue and orders is statistically insignificant.
